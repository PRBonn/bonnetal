Example semantic segmentation of People vs Background using one of the included, real-time, architectures (running at 100FPS).

By [Andres Milioto](http://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/people/andres-milioto/) _et.al_ @ University of Bonn.

In early 2018 we released [Bonnet](https://github.com/PRBonn/bonnet), which is a real-time, robotics oriented semantic segmentation framework using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Bonnet provides an easy pipeline to add architectures and datasets for semantic segmentation, in order to train and deploy CNNs on a robot. It contains a full training pipeline in Python using Tensorflow and OpenCV, and it also some C++ apps to deploy a CNN in ROS and standalone. The C++ library is made in a way which allows to add other backends (such as TensorRT).

Back then, most of my research was in the field of semantic segmentation, so that was what the framework was therefore tailored specifically to do. Since then, we have found a way to make things even more awesome, allowing for a suite of other tasks, like classification, detection, instance and semantic segmentation, feature extraction, counting, etc. Hence, the new name of this new framework: "Bonnetal", reflects that this is nothing but the old Bonnet, and then some. Hopefully, the explict _et.al._ will also spawn further collaboration and many pull requests! :smile:

We've also switched to PyTorch to allow for easier mixing of backbones, decoders, and heads for different tasks. If you are still comfortable with just semantic segmentation, and/or you're a fan of TensorFlow, you can still find the original Bonnet [here](https://github.com/PRBonn/bonnet). Otherwise, keep on reading, and I'll try to explain why Bonnetal rules!

DISCLAIMER: I am currently bringing all the functionality out from a previously closed-source framework, so be patient if the task/weights are a placeholder, and send me an email to ask for a schedule on the particular part that you need.

## Description

This code provides a framework to mix-match popular, imagenet-trained, backbones with different decoders to achieve different CNN-enabled tasks. All of these have pre-trained imagenet weights when used, that get downloaded by default if the conditions are met.

- Backbones included are (so far):
  - [ResNet 18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
  - [ResNet 34](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
  - [ResNet 50](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
  - [ResNet 101](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
  - [ResNet 152](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
  - [Darknet 53](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf)
  - [Darknet 21](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf)
  - [ERFNet](http://www.robesafe.es/personal/eduardo.romera/pdfs/Romera17tits.pdf)
  - [MobilenetsV2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381)

The main reason for the "lack" of variety of backbones so far is that imagenet pre-training takes a while, and it is pretty resource intensive. If you want a new backbone implemented we can talk about it, and you can share your resources to pretrain it :smiley: (PR's welcome :wink:)

- Tasks included are:
  
  - Full-image classification: [/train](train/tasks/classification), [/deploy](deploy/src/classification).
  - Semantic Segmentation: [/train](train/tasks/segmentation), [/deploy](deploy/src/segmentation).
  - More coming (but patience, since development is now a bit stagnant)...

The code is (like the original Bonnet) separated into a [training](train/) part developed in Python, using Pytorch, and a [deployment/inference](deploy/) part, which is fully written in C++, and contains the code to run on the robot, either using ROS or standalone.

### Docker!

An [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) container is provided to run the full framework, and as a dependency check, as well as for the continuous integration. You can check the instructions to run the containers in [/docker](docker/).

### Training

[_/train_](train/) contains Python code to easily mix and match backbones and decoders in order to train them for different image recognition tasks. It also contains helper scripts for other tasks such as converting graphs to ONNX for inference, getting image statistics for normalization, class statistics in the dataset, inference tests, accuracy assessment, etc, etc.

### Deployment

[_/deploy_](deploy/) contains C++ code for deployment on edge. Every task has its own library and namespace, and every package is a catkin package. Therefore, each `task` has 4 catkin packages:
  - A `lib` package that contains all inference files for the library.
  - A `standalone` package that shows how to use the library linked to a standalone C++ application.
  - A `ros` package that contains a node handler and some nodes to use the library with ROS for the sensor data message-passing, and
  - (optionally) a `msg` package that defines the messages required for a specific task, should this be required.

Inference is done either:
  - By generating a PyTorch traced model through the python interface that can be infered with the `libtorch` library, both on GPU and CPU, or
  - By generating an ONNX model through the python interface, that is later picked up by TensorRT, profiled in the individual computer looking at available memory and half precision capabilities, and inferer with the TensorRT engine. Notice that not all architectures are supported by TensorRT and we cannot take responsibility for this, so when you implement an architecture, do a quick test that it works with tensorRT before training it and it will make your life easier. 

### Pre-trained models

Imagenet pretrained weights for the backbones are downloaded directly to the backbones in first use, so they never start from scratch. Whenever you use a backbone for a task, if the image is RGB, then the weights from imagenet are downloaded into the backbone (unless a specific pretrained model is otherwise explicitly stated in the parameters).

These are the currently trained models we have:
